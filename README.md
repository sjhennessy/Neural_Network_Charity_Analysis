# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to utilize machine learning and neural networks to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether charity applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

### Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
